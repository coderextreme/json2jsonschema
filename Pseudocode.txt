Copy all files in examples to ALL_FOLDER
Remove bad JSON from ALL_FOLDER
Generate Java code from JSON in ALL_FOLDER with jsonschema2pojo.sh and put in X3D_FOLDER
Write all Java filenames to JAVA_FILES
Create MERGED_FOLDER
Search for files with pattern [A-Za-z0-9].java in JAVA_FILES and copy to MERGED_FOLDER
For each JAVA_FILE in MERGED_FOLDER
	Get the file name without the .java and the folder and place in FILENAME
	For the FILES result of a search for X3D_FOLDER/.../FILENAME_*.java in JAVA_FILES
		Count the words in each file of FILES
		Sort the count reversed, smallest last
		cut the 6th and 7th field
		cut the 2nd field (the 6th or 7th I think)
		Get the first line of the file which doesn have a blank line or 'total'.   Assign to BIGGEST_FILE
		Copy BIGGEST_FILE TO JAVA_FILE
Replace extra _'s in files in MERGED_FOLDER
Replace the package name in the files in MERGED_FOLDER with 'package x3djson;'
Shorten the package name in the variablename and types in the files in MERGED_FOLDER with 'x3djson.SUFFIX'
Generate Java files from XSD with xjc:  xjc -d . -p x3djson x3d-3.4.xsd x3d-3.4-Web3dExtensionsP* -b bindings.xjb
Copy files from xjc generation of files from XSD which aren't in MERGED_FOLDER to the MERGED_FOLDER
Compile the Java files in the MERGED_FOLDER
Make the CLASS_FOLDER
Copy Java classes from MERGED_FOLDER to CLASS_FOLDER
Compile the JSON schema generating class
Send the Java classes in CLASS_FOLDER to the JSON schema generator
Make the SCHEMA_FOLDER
Copy the JSON files generated by the JSON schema generatorinto SCHEMA
Send the Schema to GenSON and retrieve schema.json
